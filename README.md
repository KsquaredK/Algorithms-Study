# Algorithms-Study

I'm a newbie [code] weightlifter working on my weakest muscle group: algorithms. So I'm undertaking a weekly routine of solving algorithm challenges in Javascript, with a goal of building speed in breaking down problems into manageable chunks, and insight into the ramifications of my choices. (Like, for instance, recursive is faster than interative until suddenly...nope, it's not and now I've got a call stack error.)

### Resources
I'm getting started with Nashville's *Algorithm Night* [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-Nashville/events/lssbqsyccqbsb/), as well as *LeetCode* and *HankerRank*.

I also study a brick called *Algorithm Design Manual* a page at a time. (That puts me on page 6.)
